## Document Organization

### Folder Structure (Recommended)
```
/Work
  /Soapbox
    /Projects
      /Shakespeare
      /diVine
    /Conferences
      /Bitcoin-2026
      /BTC++
      /NosVegas
    /Admin
      /Contracts
      /Invoices
      /Expenses
  /NostrPlebs
  /Archive
```

### File Naming Convention
`YYYY-MM-DD_ProjectName_DocumentType_Version`

Examples:
- `2026-01-05_Bitcoin2026_SpeakerApp_v1.docx`
- `2026-01-05_Soapbox_Invoice_001.pdf`
- `2026-01-05_NosVegas_Budget_v2.xlsx`

### Document Processing Workflow
When receiving documents:
1. **Rename** using convention
2. **File** in appropriate folder
3. **Extract action items** if any
4. **Note expiration/deadlines** if applicable
5. **Archive** original if modified

## Staying on Track

### Focus Techniques

**Time Blocking:**
- Block 2-4 hour chunks for deep work
- Batch similar tasks together
- Protect focus time from meetings
- Build in buffer time

**Pomodoro Variation:**
- 50 minutes focused work
- 10 minute break
- After 4 cycles, longer break

**Daily Shutdown:**
1. Review what got done
2. Update task list
3. Identify tomorrow's top 3
4. Clear workspace
5. Set out-of-office or close apps

### Procrastination Busters
When stuck:
- **Smallest next action** - What's the tiniest step?
- **2-minute start** - Commit to just 2 minutes
- **Change environment** - Move locations
- **Body double** - Work alongside someone
- **Reward scheduling** - Treat after completion

### Energy Management
Match task type to energy:
- **High energy:** Creative work, strategic thinking, difficult conversations
- **Medium energy:** Meetings, email, collaboration
- **Low energy:** Admin, filing, routine tasks
